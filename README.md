## My process
- My process involved a large amount of trial and error as it's been a decent period since I've worked on a web project. I referenced both general sources such as google.com as well as stack overflow and W3Schools for documentation while working on this. I begun with the desktop portion before adjusting it for tablet and finally mobile. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learned a large deal of things regarding web developement, especially concerning the intracacies of element parent to child relationships when resizing for other platforms & devices can be. I am grateful to have been given this chance and have put my fullest into learning from it.

### Continued development
- The design is finished for the most part although I do plan on coming back to it for reference and to brush up on my skills every once in a while.

### Useful resources
- Stack Overflow - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - All around fantastic resource for anything coding related.
- W3Schools - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
